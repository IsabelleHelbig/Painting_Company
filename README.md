# including supplies and labour.  The executives remind you that a typical room in a house has four walls, with opposite walls being 
# equal.  Walls can be rectangular or square in shape.  Some rooms, however, might have fewer than four walls (not all walls will be 
# painted) or more than four (odd shaped rooms).
